  2. **Data Exploration**
  > looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.
  3. **Data Cleaning**
  > imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers
  4. **Feature Engineering**
  > modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis
  5. **Model Building**
